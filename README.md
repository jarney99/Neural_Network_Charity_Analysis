# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
We were tasked with compareing the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks. We used machine learning and neural networks to apply features to predict whether applicants will be successful.
## Results

### Data reprocessing
* The IS_SUCCESSFUL column is the feature chosen for this dataset.
* The EIN and NAME columns won't increase accuracy. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
