# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
We were tasked with compareing the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks. We used machine learning and neural networks to apply features to predict whether applicants will be successful.
## Results

### Data reprocessing
* The IS_SUCCESSFUL column is the feature chosen for this dataset.
* The EIN and NAME columns won't increase accuracy. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* Layer 1 starts at 120, then drops to 80, then 40, then 20. 
* The target was 75% but I only got it to around 46%. 

## Summary
It yielded a 46% accuracy which wasn't close to the 75% that I wanted.
